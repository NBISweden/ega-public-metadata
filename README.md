# ega-public-metadata

Python code for interacting with the [EGA (European Genome-phenome Archive) public metadata API](https://ega-archive.org/discovery/metadata/public-metadata-api/). Code and examples are provided in a Jupyter notebook.

## Prerequisites

You need to have the following installed on your system:

* Python (for example the free [Anaconda distribution](https://anaconda.org))
* [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) (JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook)
* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org)
* [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)


## Getting started

Once you have installed the required software, just open the Jupyter notebook `ega-public-metadata.ipynb` and execute the code in the cells, from top to bottom. If you are not familiar with Jupyter notebooks, you may want to first have a look at [Jupyter's documentation](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/).
